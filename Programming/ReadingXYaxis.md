**Used Material**
============
* Arduino Uno R3
* Joystick in x and y axises extracted from an old gamepad
* Breadboard
* A few cables
* A resistor (100 ohm) \\the value of resistor changes the max and min values read in Serial Port

============

You can examine the connections in picture. I directly energized the joystick from Arduino. Therefore, I needed to use a resistor between 5V and Joystick. I used 100 ohm resistor and get the values between 0-971 from both axises.
