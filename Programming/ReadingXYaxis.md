Used Material
============
1- Arduino Uno R3
2- Joystick in x and y axises extracted from an old gamepad
3- Breadboard
4- A few cables
5- A resistor (100 ohm) \\the value of resistor changes the max and min values read in Serial Port

============

You can examine the connections in picture. I directly energized the joystick from Arduino. Therefore, I needed to use a resistor between 5V and Joystick. I used 100 ohm resistor and get the values between 0-971 from both axises.
