**Used Material**
============
* Arduino Uno R3
* A FSR (Force Sensing Resistor) works between 2 N - 20 N 
* Breadboard
* A few cables
* A resistor (47 Kohm)

============

You can examine the connections in picture. I directly energized the FSR from Arduino. To get true values from analog pin I connected a 47 Kohm resistor between the ground and a pin of FSR which connected Analog 0 pin. The values are between 650 and 0.
