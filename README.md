**Design of a Tethered Quad-copter for Continuous Flying**

Flying time of quad-copters is limited to 10-15 minutes due to battery capacity. Although, a ground powered quad-copter can fly continuously and perform its mission (ie image processing, continuous video recording) for extended periods. In this project, you will design a power supply and transmission cable for a ground powered quad-copter. The aim is to minimize the mass of the transmission wire, thus it is necessary to design a step-up power converter (ie. use thinner wire using high-voltage, low current).

The project is being developed under [STAR Projects](http://star.eee.metu.edu.tr/), [Electrical-Electronics Engineering](http://eee2.metu.edu.tr/), [METU](http://www.metu.edu.tr/).
